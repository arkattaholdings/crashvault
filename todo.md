- [ ] Add tests for `crashvault list` command with various filters
- [ ] Add tests for `crashvault stats` command
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for CLI workflows
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for large event volumes

## Developer Experience
- [x] Add shell completion scripts (bash, zsh, fish)
- [ ] Create VSCode extension for inline error viewing
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality
- [ ] Implement plugin system for custom commands
- [ ] Add debug mode with verbose logging

## Cleanup
- [ ] Commit or remove untracked build/lib files
- [ ] Review and finalize RICH_STYLING.md documentation
- [ ] Clean up __pycache__ files from git tracking
- [ ] Standardize error message formatting across commands
- [ ] Refactor duplicate code in command files

## Integrations
- [ ] Slack/Discord bot for real-time error notifications

- [ ] PagerDuty/OpsGenie alert integration
- [ ] Grafana datasource plugin for crash dashboards
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- [ ] Jira ticket auto-creation from high-severity crashes

## Analytics & Insights
- [ ] Crash trend visualization (CLI sparklines or web dashboard)
- [ ] Error frequency heatmap by time of day
- [ ] Automatic root cause grouping using stacktrace clustering
- [ ] Regression detection — alert when a resolved issue reappears
- [ ] Impact scoring based on frequency × severity
- [ ] Weekly/monthly crash summary reports via email or webhook

## Multi-user & Team Features
- [ ] Team workspaces with shared crash vaults
- [ ] Role-based access control for shared vaults
- [ ] Crash assignment — assign issues to team members
- [ ] Comment threads on individual crashes
- [ ] Activity feed showing team actions on issues
- [ ] Crash review workflows (triage → assign → fix → verify)

## Storage & Performance
- [ ] SQLite backend option for large-scale local storage
- [ ] Event archival — auto-archive old resolved issues
- [ ] Compressed export formats (gzip JSON, SQLite dumps)
- [ ] Lazy loading for large event histories
- [ ] Configurable storage backends (file, SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Event streaming to external stores (S3, GCS)

## SDK & Language Support
- [ ] JavaScript/Node.js SDK for automatic error capture
- [ ] Go panic handler integration
- [ ] Rust panic hook integration
- [ ] Java/Kotlin exception handler
- [ ] Ruby exception middleware
- [ ] Generic language-agnostic SDK via HTTP client libraries

## Future Ideas
- [ ] Support for attachments in webhook notifications
- [ ] Implement alerting rules engine (e.g., "notify if >10 errors/min")
- [ ] Add machine learning for error classification
- [ ] Support for distributed tracing integration
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Sharing Crashes via MD or JSON
- [ ] Browser extension for capturing frontend JS errors
- [ ] Mobile crash reporting (React Native, Flutter)
- [ ] Offline-first sync — merge crash vaults across machines
- [ ] Encrypted vault mode for sensitive error data
- [ ] Crash replay — reproduce errors from captured context
- [ ] Natural language search ("show me all database errors from last week")
