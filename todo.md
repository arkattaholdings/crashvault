# Crashvault TODO

## Competitor Roadmap (from COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md)

### Phase 1: Polish Current Features
- [ ] Smart deduplication — Group errors by stacktrace similarity
- [ ] Rich TUI — Interactive terminal UI for browsing crashes
- [x] Batch operations — Bulk resolve, export, tag

### Phase 2: Differentiators (CrashVault Superpowers)
- [x] Encrypted vaults — Password-protected local storage (unique!)
- [ ] Offline sync — Merge crash vaults across machines (unique!)
- [ ] Crash replay — Reproduce errors from captured context (unique!)
- [ ] Privacy-first analytics — Trends, heatmaps — all local (unique!)
- [ ] Natural language search — "show me db errors from yesterday" (unique!)

### Phase 3: Developer Experience
- [ ] Plugin system — Custom commands, formatters, exporters
- [ ] VSCode extension — Inline error viewing
- [ ] Interactive crash share — Generate shareable links/MD (unique!)
- [ ] Template system — Custom webhook/message templates

### Phase 4: Integrations (Match competitors)
- [ ] Sentry-compatible endpoint — Ingest from Sentry SDKs locally
- [x] GitHub Issues auto-creation
- [x] Slack/Discord/Teams webhooks
- [x] Jira ticket creation
- [ ] CI/CD integration

### Phase 5: Multi-language SDKs (Match Sentry)
- [ ] Node.js SDK
- [ ] Go panic handler
- [ ] Rust panic hook
- [ ] Generic HTTP client for any language
